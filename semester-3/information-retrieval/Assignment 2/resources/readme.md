- `IR_Assignment.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating Evaluation of Classification Algorithms on Imbalanced Data.


A) Search for a dataset containing imbalanced classes for classification analysis.

B)
	a) Implement Python functions to handle class imbalance and train classifiers such as Naive Bayes and KNN on the imbalanced dataset. Evaluate the classifiers using performance metrics adjusted for imbalanced data, such as F1-score, precision-recall curves, and ROC-AUC.
	b) Discuss the challenges of dealing with imbalanced data in classification tasks and compare the performance of Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers in handling imbalanced datasets.

Please refer to individual notebooks for detailed information and instructions.
