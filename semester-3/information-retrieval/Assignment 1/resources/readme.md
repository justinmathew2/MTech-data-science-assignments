# Information Retrieval Assignment
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks and dataset for Skip List Implementation.

## Notebooks

- `IR_Assignment.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating Skip List Implementation.

## Data

- `data/`: Folder containing dataset used in the notebooks.

A) Explore open-source datasets or document collections where efficient searching is crucial for constructing an inverted index using a skip list.

B)a) Implement a basic skip list data structure in Python. Explain how a skip list facilitates efficient searching compared to traditional data structures.

  b) Modify the skip list implementation to store inverted index entries efficiently. Discuss the advantages and potential challenges of using skip lists for inverted index construction.

Please refer to individual notebooks for detailed information and instructions.
