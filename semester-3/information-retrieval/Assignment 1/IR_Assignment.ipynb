    "### The Movie Database (TMDb):\n",

    "TMDb is a community-driven movie and TV database. Efficient searching can enhance the retrieval of movie-related information for analysis, recommendation systems, and other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Exchange Datasets:\n",

    "A skip list facilitates efficient searching compared to traditional data structures, such as linked lists or binary search trees, by introducing a hierarchical structure with multiple levels of linked lists. The primary advantage of skip lists is that they provide a compromise between the simplicity of linked lists and the efficiency of balanced trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how a skip list achieves efficient searching:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Levels:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a skip list, each element is present in multiple levels of linked lists, with the bottom level containing all elements and higher levels containing a subset of the elements.\n",
    "Higher levels skip over elements in the lower levels, reducing the number of nodes that need to be traversed during a search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip lists use a probabilistic approach to determine the levels at which nodes should appear. This randomization helps balance the tree and prevents worst-case scenarios.\n",
    "Randomization ensures that the average height of the skip list is logarithmic, leading to an average-case time complexity of O(log n) for search operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficient Traversal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "During a search, the algorithm starts at the top-left corner and moves down and to the right. It only moves down to lower levels when the key in the current node is greater than the target key.\n",
    "This skipping of nodes at higher levels makes the traversal more efficient, as it eliminates unnecessary comparisons and reduces the number of steps required to find the desired element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balanced Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip lists maintain a balanced structure similar to balanced trees. The randomization of levels ensures that, on average, the number of nodes at each level is limited, preventing skewed structures that could lead to poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip lists support dynamic operations, including insertions and deletions, without requiring a rebalancing process as in some other tree structures.\n",
    "Dynamic operations can be performed efficiently by adjusting the levels of nodes as needed, maintaining the logarithmic average-case complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees, skip lists are simpler to implement. They require fewer complex operations during insertion, deletion, and search, making them an attractive choice for scenarios where simplicity is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaptability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip lists are adaptable to various data distributions and access patterns. The randomization used in determining levels allows them to perform well across a wide range of scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "A skip list facilitates efficient searching by combining a hierarchical structure with randomization. This design reduces the number of comparisons needed during a search, resulting in an average-case time complexity that is logarithmic and comparable to more complex tree structures. The skip list's simplicity and dynamic nature make it a practical choice for scenarios where efficient searching is required without the overhead of complex tree balancing operations.\n",

    "### B b) Modify the skip list implementation to store inverted index entries efficiently. Discuss the advantages and potential challenges of using skip lists for inverted index construction. (4 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip lists have both advantages and potential challenges when used for inverted index construction. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficient Search Operations:**\n",
    "Skip lists provide efficient search operations with an average time complexity of O(log n), making them suitable for quickly retrieving information from an inverted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balanced Structure:**\n",
    "Skip lists maintain a balanced structure, which ensures that search operations are evenly distributed across levels. This balance contributes to the efficiency of the search process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Structure:**\n",
    "Skip lists are dynamic data structures, allowing for easy insertion and deletion of elements. This dynamic nature is particularly beneficial when the inverted index needs to be updated frequently, such as when new documents are added or existing ones are modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simplicity of Implementation:**\n",
    "Skip lists are relatively simple to implement compared to other data structures like balanced trees. The simplicity of implementation can be an advantage, especially in scenarios where ease of development is a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic Structure:**\n",
    "Skip lists use a probabilistic approach to determine the levels of nodes, making them adaptable to various datasets. The randomization involved in determining node levels helps prevent the occurrence of worst-case scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Potential Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Overhead:**\n",
    "Skip lists may have higher memory overhead compared to other data structures, such as hash tables. Each node in the skip list requires additional pointers for forward traversal, which can increase the overall memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity of Implementation:**\n",
    "While skip lists are simpler than some other data structures, they still require careful implementation to ensure correctness. The logic for insertion, deletion, and search operations can be error-prone if not implemented correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic Nature of Probabilities:**\n",
    "The use of randomization in determining node levels is based on probabilities. In certain cases, the deterministic nature of these probabilities might lead to suboptimal performance or even unintended patterns in the skip list structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limited Performance Guarantees:**\n",
    "Skip lists offer probabilistic performance guarantees. While they provide average-case time complexity advantages, there is no strict guarantee on the worst-case time complexity. In specific situations, other data structures might provide more predictable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limited to Sorted Keys:**\n",
    "Skip lists are effective when keys are sorted. For inverted index construction, where terms are often sorted, this is an advantage. However, if sorting is not a requirement, other data structures like hash tables might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Conclusion\n",
    "Skip lists offer a good balance between efficiency and simplicity, but application's characteristics and needs should be properly considered before selecting skip lists as the underlying data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below implementation stores inverted index entries"
